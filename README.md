# Journey to Valhalla pimped version

This is a pimped version of the journey to valhalla mod.

## Overview about pimped features

* Nature (trees and some ores and seeds) will regenerate after being harvested
* Adds Better Wards to make buildings indestructible and auto fuels fires and stuff
* Adds CLLC and brings CLLC's ItemConfig for all the items to not lose them on 
death and reconfigures item stacks, weight and teleporting abilities removed for all ores and metals
* Adds some base mods that I feel come handy any time playing the game, like crafting from chests, etc.
* You don't loose skills on death, since even with vanilla it is hard to not die and get the skill to any 
valuable
