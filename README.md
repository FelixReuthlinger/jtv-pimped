# Journey to Valhalla pimped version

This is a pimped version of the 
[Journey to Valhalla](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/thedefside/Journey_To_Valhalla/) mod pack.

## Overview about pimped features

* Nature will regenerate after being harvested
  * trees (birch, fir, pine, oak)
  * ores (tin)
  * seeds (turnip spawns more often)
* Adds Better Wards to 
  * make buildings indestructible
  * auto fuels fires
* Adds CLLC ItemConfigs for all the items to 
  * not lose them on death 
  * reconfigures item stacks and weight
  * teleporting abilities removed for all ores and metals
* Adds some base mods that I feel come handy any time playing the game, like crafting from chests, etc.
* You don't loose skills on death, since even with vanilla it is hard to not die and get the skill to any 
valuable
